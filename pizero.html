            <h2>Raspberry Pi Zero</h2>
            <p>The Raspberry Pi Zero was released in 2015, and still runs Raspberry Pi OS, but at a cheaper cost, and a slower speed than the 5 and 4, making it useful for projects that require strong computing power, but in a smaller form factor.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <p><strong>How does it compare to Pi 4 and Pi 5?</strong></p>
            <p>Pi Zero is slower than Pi 4 and 5, but it comes in a smaller size, and at a lesser cost.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>What can I use it for?</strong></p>
            <p>Zero is good for most projects, especially smaller ones where you can't fit a bigger Pi, or where you don't want to use a more expensive computer.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Can I still use it with a monitor?</strong></p>
            <p>Although Pi Zero doesn't have a HDMI port, it does have a miniHDMI port, so it will still connect to a display. You can also connect a keyboard and mouse to it.</p>
